#### Problem Statement:
An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

#### Goals of the Case Study:
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
Approach / Steps to Follow

#### To achieve the goals outlined above, the following steps will be taken:
1. Data Understanding: Load the dataset and get familiar with its structure (features, missing values, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand key relationships and insights from the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Create or transform features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
5. Model Building: Build a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion and assign lead scores.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
7. Optimization: Optimize the model based on performance metrics and business requirements.
8. Final Model: Present the final model and recommendations.
